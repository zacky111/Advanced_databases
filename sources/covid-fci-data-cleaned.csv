Further, courts will not stay insolvency proceedings against protected debtors that were pending before 6 April 2020. - a simplified procedure for the approval of settlement agreements if insolvency proceedings of a protected person commence within three months after the termination of the moratorium has been introduced: settlement agreements must be approved by 50% of the creditors of a protected debtor present at the creditors' meeting and all secured creditors present at the creditors' meeting (rather than 50% of all registered creditors and all secured creditors). Additionally, a creditor may approve specific conditions of a settlement agreement with a protected debtor during the moratorium period, and it will be a valid approval of a settlement in the insolvency of the protected debtor. - a protected debtor that has filed an insolvency petition during the moratorium may apply for approval of a restructuring plan after the court introduces the first insolvency procedure and the first creditors' meeting takes place. There is no need for approval of the debt restructuring plan by the creditors. The court would approve it if the following criteria are met: the debtor's income for the accounting period in 2020 has decreased by 20% or more as compared to the relevant accounting period in a previous year (if the accounting period is not yet complete, the court would consider the debtor's income for 2019 and 2018); the debtor has no indebtedness on claims of compensation for damage to health or loss of life, or in relation to severance payments and employees' salaries; its creditors have not reached a decision on amicable settlement at a creditors' meeting; its creditors have not filed pre-moratorium insolvency petitions that have been returned by the court due to the introduction of the moratorium; and the debtor files an insolvency petition one month after the introduction of the moratorium or later (i.e. not earlier than 6 May 2020). -  Change in the consequences of insolvency of individual entrepreneurs if more than 50 % of their unsettled debt has matured during the moratorium and/or such debts were subject to a debt restructuring plan or a settlement agreement approved in court proceedings initiated during the moratorium.
